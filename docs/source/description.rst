    :alt: Workflow diagram of bowshockpy for computation of the bowshock model spectral cubes.

``bowshockpy`` works as follows. 

* From the mass and momentum conservation equations `Ostriker et al. (2001) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...557..443O/abstract>`_ and `Tabone et al. (2018) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...614A.119T/abstract>`_, one can obtain the morphology and kinematics of the bowshock shell from a few model parameters.
* The model parameters are:
